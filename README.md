## Description

Nes Application is simple application to read news. I used [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) to get news. 
The app also works offline if it was used while connected to the Internet. I used the Room DB for this. 
Each time the user updates the news, they save it in the room and delete the previous ones, if any. 
And when there is no Internet connection the app uses news from room. 
Also in app you can search news and read them. when you open the news it opens in another activity and shows all description that API gives, but you can open news in browser or  share with this news. 
Below you can see how app works.
